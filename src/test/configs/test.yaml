  default: 5m
  setup: 2m
  teardown: 2m
  unit: 30s

  silver: 5s    # Silver tier requirement: <5s
  gold: 30s     # Gold tier requirement: <30s
  percentile_95: 1.5x  # Maximum allowed degradation at 95th percentile
  percentile_99: 2x    # Maximum allowed degradation at 99th percentile

# Performance testing requirements and thresholds
performance_requirements:
  min_throughput: 1000          # Minimum events/second per client

  max_concurrent_clients: 100   # Maximum concurrent client support
  batch_size: 1000             # Standard event batch size
  ramp_up_time: 30s            # Load test ramp-up period
  steady_state_time: 5m        # Steady state test duration
  cool_down_time: 30s          # Cool-down period

# Retry configuration for handling transient failures
retry_settings:
  max_attempts: 3              # Maximum retry attempts
