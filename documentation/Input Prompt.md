# Product Requirements Document
## BlackPoint Security Integration Framework

### 1. Executive Summary

#### 1.1 Project Overview
BlackPoint Cyber requires a scalable integration framework to ingest security-related data from third-party platforms into their security monitoring system. This framework will accelerate their ability to develop and deploy new security product integrations.

#### 1.2 Business Context
Currently:
- Each integration costs $15-40K
- Development takes 6-8 weeks with contractors
- Running 6-8 integrations in parallel
- Need to scale from 10 to 30 integrations per year
- Critical for marketability and security capabilities

#### 1.3 Strategic Goals
- Reduce integration development time from 6-8 weeks to 2 weeks
- Maintain 80%+ accuracy compared to manual development
- Enable scaling to 30+ integrations per year
- Reduce resource requirements and costs
- Maintain security and compliance standards

### 2. System Architecture

#### 2.1 Infrastructure Components
- Kubernetes for microservices deployment
- Confluent (migrated from Kafka) for message streaming
- ChaosSearch with S3 backing for data storage
- REST APIs for data access and integration

#### 2.2 Three-Tier Data Architecture

##### Bronze Tier (Raw Data Storage)
Purpose: "very much just store the data"

Data Schema:
```json
{
    "source_event": {
        // Original event exactly as received
    },
    "metadata": {
        "collection_timestamp": "ISO8601",
        "source_system": "string",
        "client_id": "string",
        "collector_version": "string",
        "batch_id": "string"
    }
}
```

Requirements:

- Preserve complete original data
- Store in ChaosSearch
- Enable Elasticsearch API querying
- Implement client-specific retention
- Stream through Confluent

##### Silver Tier (Processing)

Purpose: "post-processing aggregation normalization"

Data Schema:

```json
{
    "event_id": "string",
    "normalized_timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "source": {
        "system": "string",
        "event_type": "string",
        "original_id": "string"
    },
    "actor": {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "string",
        "attributes": {}
    },
    "action": {
        "type": "string",
        "status": "string",
        "details": {}
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "string",
        "attributes": {}
    },
    "context": {
        "client_id": "string",
        "environment": "string",
        "additional_data": {}
    }
}
```

Requirements:

- Transform to standard schema
- Normalize timestamps and fields
- Aggregate related events
- Maintain data lineage
- Process in near real-time

##### Gold Tier (Security Intelligence)

Purpose: "bring that normalized data together to generate business data"

Data Schema:

```json
{
    "alert_id": "string",
    "detection_time": "ISO8601",
    "type": "string",
    "severity": "string",
    "source_events": ["array of event_ids"],
    "entities": {
        "users": [],
        "systems": [],
        "resources": []
    },
    "context": {
        "client_id": "string",
        "environment": "string"
    },
    "details": {
        "description": "string",
        "recommendations": [],
        "references": []
    },
    "metadata": {
        "detection_rule": "string",
        "confidence_score": "number"
